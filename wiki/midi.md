**BIO:**  
A young mercenary in training who was formerly a pirate after being adopted by [Emperor Pendragon](pendragon.md). Midi became an orphan when he was six at the same time he discovered his affinity for bomb magic when his family's car ran off the road into a river. Midi saw a [shadewing](shadewing.md) after escaping the flooding car, and in a panic, cast his first bomb, blasting himself out of the river. His parents were unable to escape from the vehicle and drowned.

He had trouble adjusting to foster life, and was bounced between households after repeatedly blowing up things that belonged to each foster family while trying to learn to control his powers. This along with his lingering trauma from losing his parents caught the attention of Emperor Pendragon, who decided to adopt him under the guise of a youth counselor who specialized in children with volatile [magic](magic.md).

For most of his time in the Cold Front, Midi was mostly treated as just a weapon by many of the pirates, only really making a connection with Pendragon's nephew, [Puck](puck.md), who had also lost his parents. He developed a penchant for snark and puns to help him deal with the abbrasive attitudes of the rest of the Cold Front, in particular that of [Dr. Quincey](drq.md).

During an away mission, shortly before the events of the game, he was sent to raid a building during an attack on a town, and saw a child who looked like he did when he was little that criticized him for his actions. He decided that he would escape the Cold Front and give up piracy forever at the first chance he got.

**GAMEPLAY:**  
Midi is the most straightforward platformer character. He has lower physical attack power and depends more on his elemental bombs that come in four types:

![Bombs](img/bombs.gif)

* Normal - A pure kineetic explosion that deals damage but does not have an elemental effect. When charged, it can be launched at a greater distance and deals extra damage. This type costs the least amount of energy to use.
* Fire - Adds a burning effect that slowly damages enemies over time. Can also be used to burn down certain plant matter and weaker ice blocks to open passages. When charged, it creates a bigger explosion and deals extra damage.
* Shock - Adds a static effect that causes enemies to pass along an electric charge that damages them when spread, and slows enemies down through paralisys. Electricity can also be used to power conduits and charge machinery. Underwater, the static effect can jump further. When charged, it creates a ball of lightning that lingers and launches lightning bolts at enemies.
* Ice - Adds a freezing effect that stops enemies cold when their health is low. Flying enemies will fall and take damage when frozen, except when under water. When charged, it creates a swirling blizzard that freezes all enemies caught in it, regardless of health (except bosses).
* Dark - Creates a gravity well that pulls in enemies and damages them with intense pressure. Cannot be used normally, but must be built up by taking damage.

His bombs can be dispensed in several ways:

* Throwing - The basic attack he starts with. It can be aimed in eight directions, and throws bombs in an arc.
* Charging - Midi has two charge levels. The more he charges, the more damage it'll do, and the bigger the explosion, at the cost of additional energy, and the larger nut being larger and heavier, reducing its thrown range..
* Spinning - When on the ground, pressing down and forward while throwing will instead spin the bomb like a top along the ground, making it much easier to hit enemies that are too low to easily hit by throwing.
* Planting - Midi can have one landmine planted at a time. This is done by holding down while standing and pressing the bomb button. If Midi jumps while standing on a mine, it will explode under him, launching him into the air for a much higher jump.
* Dropping - While in his transphere, Midi will leave a remote or time bomb on the ground. Rapidly dropping and detonating remote bombs will allow limited bomb laddering.

Even when charged, Midi's bombs suffer a speed reduction when under water.

![Transphere](img/transphere.gif)

Midi's transphere is basically a morphball, but with two differences to its Metroid counterpart. One, it does not play a spinning animation when stationary, and instead, rolls according to the speed its travelling at. Two, it obeys slopes, and will gain speed depending on the direction of the slope it is on. It can move at the same speeds Midi can while running, but has lower friction because it's a ball.

The sides of the ball (middle of the sprite) are actually made of glass, and Midi's body can be seen spinning inside. The explanation of why he does not get dizzy is that because [pillbugs](biometals.md), the creatures from which the transphere came from, can be transported rather roughly when in their ball forms, and use internal inertial dampeners to protect their more sensitive circuitry.

Midi gains the transphere when he encounters the biometal general, Honey Vespa, who attempts to bind pillbug armor to him, successfully integrating the cybernetics with him after her minions wore down his aura enough for her to break through and operate on him, designating him as her experiment number 4919.

Midi can travel between areas by returning to the Cloud Chaser and speaking to Sophie, who will list what areas can be travelled to and what missions are available for each one. New areas are unlocked as the game progresses. Trey will give story missions as Midi gains experience while he investigates the Cold Front, and will join in some of the story missions as a switchable partner.
