# Hidegvins

The penguin-like race of hidegvins are known most for their incredible connection to the [ice element](magic.md). Every hidegvin is capable of conjuring at least a little, and are able to chill liquids just by being close to them. Despite their ability to cool just about anything, they still prefer to live in colder climates to conserve energy.

Unlike their penguin cousins, hidegvins do have hands, albeit with flatter fingers than other races that still help them retain a sort of wing/flipper-like shape. This makes them much more agile underwater, but sacrifices some dexterity; it isn't unusual to see a hidegvin carrying common objects around with both hands to help their grip.

While perfectly fine with catching fish the wild way, they still enjoy cooking, and are known to come up with the world's most popular seafood dishes. Because of their affinity for the water that rivals even marstels, and a resistance to cold that outclasses them, hidegvin settlements are the leading exporters of polar fish and tundra-dwelling flora.

## Subarcterra

The haven city of the hidegvins is a massive ice cavern under the antarctic shelf. Shaped and reinforced by hidegvin magic, the structures in this city are so resistant to heat that even dragon fire does not melt them. The ice is frozen solid enough that it is safe to run electrical wiring through, allowing modern furnishings to be included.

Ice bricks used for walls are normally white, but can be dyed to give buildings distinguishing colors and designs so that the entire city doesn't look identical. Once the bricks are arranged, they are shaved and smoothed into a variety of shapes, allowing hidegvin structures to take just about any shape.

## Notes

Hidegvin is a portmanteau of Hungarian words "hideg" meaning "chill" and "pingvin" meaning "penguin". It's both a reference to my herritage and to Chill Penguin from Mega Man X, my favorite game as a kid.
