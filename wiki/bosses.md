# Bosses

## ==== Biometals ====

### Cortex Vespa

* **Type:** Semi-flying
* **Attack:** Stinger needle (2 damage, rapid shot, grabbable), summon pillbug, summon hoverbee
* **Health:** 200

Large queen bee biometal. Her abdomen is a data processing server. She can control other biometals remotely and will summon them to defend her. Her needle spikes can be grabbed and thrown back.

She is technically a traitor to other biometals. She created the transphere and programmed it to bind with Kyrodians who come near, looking for one who will make a compatible match.

## ==== Cold Front ====

### [Emperor Pendragon](pendragon.md)

* **Type:** Heavy
* **Attack:** Spinning slash, rolling slash, ice sword beam, blizzard pillar
* **Health:** 1000, fire damage x 2.0, ice damage x 0.0
* **Attributes:** Unfreezeable

Will parry some ranged attacks with his sword. When low on health, blizzard pillar becomes a desperation move, stretching out wide. It can be countered with a charged fire bomb.

If [Hunter](hunter.md) shinesparks into him, he will attempt to block it, forcing Hunter to mash attack to break his guard. Successfully breaking it will do major damage.

### [Dr. Quincey](quincey.md)

* **Type:** Flying
* **Attack:** Homing missiles (fire damage, grabbable), lightning
* **Health:** 300
