# Platformer Mode

This mode is used for dungeons, missions, and battles. Dungeons are played Metroidvania-style, and can be revisted after the player has accquired new abilities for completionists. Mini dungeons used for instanced missions will usually be linear, but not always.

Background and foreground elements are identified by contrast in color and shade. Background elements will blend into the backdrop while foreground elements use a sharper contrast to stand out and show they are solid.

## Gimmicks

* **Stationary Platform** - Some floating platforms float freely, held up by levitite minerals, while others are held up by non-colliding background elements, such as being fixed into walls or held by chains. Some can be jumped up onto from beneath, and can be jumped down from by pressing jump while holding down.

* **Linear Platform** - These move between two points, and are almost always passable from beneath.

* **Tracked Platform** - These follow a predefined path. They can be set to reverse, loop, stop, or destroy, and can execute code at any point in their path.

* **Water** - Basic liquid environment. Players will drown if they stay under for too long. An air tank will increase how long the player can stay under. When the player resurfaces, they will instantly regain as much air as they can hold without a tank while the rest refills over time. A rebreather allows for unlimited time under water. Ice bombs that detonate underwater will create temporary ice blocks that float.

* **Acid** - Causes steady damage while submerged. Can be shielded against using consumable shields or the infinite Valiant Shield. Rebreathers do not work under acid.

* **Lava** - Causes damage that increases with continuous contact. Damage multiplier falls while outside lava. Variant shield will reduce intial damage and slow multiplier increase. Rebreathers do not work under lava.

* **Magnetic Rail** - These are used by biometals to move around quickly. Midi can use these after upgrading his transphere.

* **Springus** - A mushroom that reacts to anything touching it by pressing upward, launching the offending object away. Acts as a bounce pad for players. Can also bounce Midi's bombs. One of them will look like the XYG logo.

* **Power Node** - Reacts to electrical attacks by powering anything wired to it.

* **Fuse Line** - Reacts to fire attacks, sending a flame from the tip to anything it's attached to.
