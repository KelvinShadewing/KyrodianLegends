## How to Play

This game runs in the [XYG Studio](https://github.com/KelvinShadewing/XYG-Studio) game engine.

To run, it, build the runtime (sorry, no release yet), and install it to wherever your terminal can call it without the need for a path. On UNIX-like systems, this will be your `/usr/bin/` folder. On Windows, it can be anywere as long as your `%PATH%` variable is set to it. You should be able to open a command prompt/terminal and simply type in `xyg`.

From here, go to where you downloaded Kyrodian Legends and open a terminal/command prompt, and type in `xyg kyle.nut`. If it worked, you should see a small window appear with Midi. If you don't see Midi, move the mouse around; he's attached to it. Click anywhere on the screen to drop a ball.

This is simply a test function to demonstrate instance management. If you look on the console window, you'll see it announce whenever a ball is made or deleted, along with a count of how many actors are on screen (Midi himself is not an actor at this point).
