# The Cold Front

The Cold Front is a pirate faction led by [Emperor Pendragon](pendragon.md), and, with the temporary exception of [Midi Waffle](midi.md), is made up entirely of [hidegvins](hidegvins.md). Hidegvin members turn their feathers blue using a special bleach that removes all but the blue pigments, allowing them to retain their white underbellies despite being a full-body process.

Cold Front members are required to learn at least a basic ice ball [spell](magic.md) for use in combat, as well as being able to pilot and maintain the planes used during air raids. Because they can never predict when and where they will be needed, CF members are expected to be able to make at least a basic contribution to any situation in addition to their own main stations and specialties.

## The Avalanche

The Avalanche is the Cold Front flagship. It is roughly the size of a US naval carrier in length, shaped like a large, blue penguin sliding on its belly through the air. The beak is able to open up into a storage bay that can be used to capture small ships or load/unload cargo when docked. The sides of the belly open up into the main attack hangar, wherein a fleet of 40 fighter planes, also bearing a blue penguin appearance, can be launched from out the sides simultaneously. The beak bay floor can open into a track that takes returning planes down and reloads them into the hangar, thanks to an automation system designed by [Dr. Quincey](quincey.md).

Another use for the beak is to collect fish from the ocean. To do this, the storage area is sealed off, and the lower passage connects to a netted area. Fish are caught in the nets, with ones of different sizes falling into separate nets to sort them, and water is allowed to flow back out the bottom through a gutter system. This allows the ship to be more self sustaining, lessening the need to stop for supplies, as hidegvins can live comfortably on an all-seafood diet.

The blue area of the hull is lined with windows for each of the quarters on the living deck, as well as gunner stations on each of the two battle decks, which sandwich the living deck between them. The windows are made from composite plastic that's just as strong as the steel hull, while also bending the same way instead of shattering when struck, making them much safer than glass windows.

Just above the hangar, within the defended center of the first battle deck, is the power supply room, which houses a nuclear diamond cluster that powers all of the ship's electrical systems. Closer to the front is Dr. Quincey's lab, which is divided into a smaller room for designing and working with smaller machines, and a larger room for testing and assembling larger prototypes, though those are often tested outside of the ship.

The living deck, just above the wings, features crew quarters along the back two thirds, with the front featuring a galley on one side, and an open room on the other that can be used for recreation and training.
