# Magic

Magic in Kyrodian Legends is defined as the process in which mana, a psycho-reactive energy, is manipulated by the will of the user to perform tasks and act upon the physical world. To understand how it works, one must first know about the fourth dimension. In KL, the fourth dimension is not time, but another dimension of space itself. Matter and energy that do not overlap on this fourth dimension is capable of phasing through each other within normal three dimensional space. The scale used to measure and represent the fourth dimensional position and width of a given matter type is known as the 4th spectrum.

Because mana is slightly out of phase, only partially overlapping physical matter on the 4th spectrum, and is capable of temporarily moving further away, it can be instructed to do things that appear to break the laws of three dimensional physics. In fact, any matter can have its position changed on the 4th spectrum, but will always attempt to return to its natural position, called the 4th rest, requiring constant energy to be exerted to maintain an altered phase.

When a mage casts a spell, their brain translates their will into an electronic signal that the mana in their body will react to, similar to the electronic signals that tell the muscles when and how to move. After completing its task, the mana will return to a resting state, at which point it can be reabsorbed by living beings. Areas with high concentrations of mana can be beneficial to mages who have learned to draw it in on command. This is done by willing the mana in their bodies to compress, creating a void that pulls ambient energy in like a vacuum. However, this can have harmful effects if too much is drawn in at once, as once the compression stops, the mana will attempt to spread out within its new host, and may damage them by leaking out.

Enchanting is the process of ordering mana to take on a new host and use the stored energy their to perform a persistent task. Because enchanted objects are wrapped in a magical aura, they are capable of interacting with ethereal entities, which is why, for example, an enchanted sword is needed to fight a ghost.

## Elements

Elemental magic comes in eight forms, half of which representing forms of matter, and the other half representing forms of energy.

|Matter|Energy|
|------|------|
|Earth |Fire  |
|Water |Ice   |
|Air   |Shock |
|Dark  |Light |

Mages with elemental skill tend to lean towards one or the other type, matter or energy. However, this is where the yin-yang principal comes into play. A mage who specializes in energy will have one matter element they can use, and one who specializes in matter will have one energy element. For example, [Midi](midi.md) can use fire, ice, and shock bombs, and can also make dark bombs that create a gravity well.

## Psionics

On rare occasions, a person will be born able to learn psionic abilities instead of magic. Psi, the energy used in psionics, does not share a 4th space with mana, but does with physical matter, meaning the two energies do not have any effect on one another and must use some physical means in order to affect each other. Because of the 4th distance from mana, psionics are virtually useless against ethereal beings, making psychic types not very effective against ghosts.

Despite common belief, having psionic abilities does not automatically grant one telepathy, mind reading, or mind control. While it is possible to learn telepathy fairly easy, in order to read minds, the user would first have to learn to sense and understand brain waves, which for non-telepaths, have an extremely short emission range. It works like a radio; if one is not actually transmitting, the other cannot recieve anything. Physical contact is necessary to read minds psionically without the one being read being a telepath. In fact, it is actually those recieving telepathic messages who are reading the mind of the psychic.

Mind control is even more complicated, requiring the user to have an intimate understanding of the subject's thought process in order to get the desired result, otherwise, it would be like pushing buttons without knowing what they do. Most psychics, at best, are able to learn empathic compulsion, projecting their emotions or memories of emotions onto others.

[Shadewings](shadewings.md) are all born with psionic abilities.

## Goats

Kyrodian goats are unique and mystical creatures that regularly defy the laws of physics in ways that even arch mages have been unable to define. They are reportedly capable of ingesting and metabolizing any material, even solid metal. Despite these awesome powers, they are quite gentle and friendly, though shadewings seem to have an irrational fear of them.
