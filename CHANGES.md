#Change log

## 19-6-2018

* **Add change log** - I've not been keeping track of changes well enough, so here you go. Gonna use this as a sort of dev journal at the same time.
* **Update Midi's sprite** - Midi can now walk slowly instead of just running and sprinting. Had to lengthen his legs a bit, because they looked too short while moving. I also moved a few things around to keep the sheet looking clean and added some padding to the door and lift/elevator animations, since I want to have transition frames instead of him just snapping into place.
* **Remove Midi/Trey/Sophie portraits** - Pending license agreement. The portraits were originally sketched by Foxboy83, who I'm still waiting to hear back from about being allowed to modify and relicense them. He never actually gave me any terms when I had him make them, and has not gotten back to me about it since, so I'll probably end up replacing them entirely. The shadewing faces are my own art.
