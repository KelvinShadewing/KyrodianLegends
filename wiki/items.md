# Items

**Vitum Cell** - Increases maximum HP by 100.

**Mana Cell** - Increases maximum magic/stamina. Not compatible with Hunter.

**Thermal Barrier** - Consumable shield for acid and extreme temperatures. Recharges over time when outside of hazards. If drained, the device breaks and must be replaced.

**Va(r/l)iant Shield** - Unlimited protection from acid and convection. No one in game can agree on whether to call it a Variant Shield or a Valiant Shield, and so the name flip-flops randomly whenever viewed in the inventory.

**Air Tank** - Extends how long the player can remain submerged. Recharges when surfaced. The player will instantly regain a minimum amount of air upon resurfacing, the amount they can hold without a tank.

**Rebreather** - Unlimited time under clean water. Under acid, the air tank takes over.

**Hazmat Filter** - Allows the rebreather to work in acid.

**Retank** - Unlimited air in any environment.

**Canteen** - Allows healing on command from the menu using stored energy. Can be refilled and expanded with money.

## Notes

* I don't know when the retank will come into play, but I think it would be neat to have a space encounter at some point. Also, it needs a better name.
