**BIO:**  
Hunter was originally created during the late Renassiance era by Apex Technologies as the prototype shadewing, but his mind and body were created at separate times. Having been trapped in a cryotube for many decades, Hunter's original mind, named Zero, found a way to escape technopathically and inserted himself into a biometal hatchery. While Zero constructed his new body, Hunter's mind began to form to fill in the void left in the shadewing's brain.

After years in stasis, the old lab would be discovered under the ruins of Gulsandur by [Midi](midi.md). The lab had years ago been attacked by biometals and sealed off after attempts to hide it by using the old ruin had failed. Hunter would meet Midi, and end up chosing his name when the first word that comes to mind happens to be "Hunter". Exploring the lab, he would learn the source of this word, that he was designed to be an assassin, primarily by hunting pirate captains through stealth. He decides to join Midi in escaping the pirates, and upon learning how Midi's parents perished, he decides that his intended purpose may work for him after all.

Hunter is typically very quiet and does not enjoy speaking out loud. When he does, however, he speaks in a terse but formal way, similar to a Vulcan. Despite this cold outward demeanor, he is very empathetic, and has a strong affection for Midi.

**GAMEPLAY:**  
As a green-eyed shadewing, Hunter is capable of psionic telekinesis similar to the Gravity Gun from Half Life 2. He can lift and throw both heavy objects and certain enemies, in addition to using his claws and fangs for melee attacks.

His wings allow him to glide and perform repeated midair jumps. The number of jumps can be upgraded as the story progresses. His attraction radius, the distance in which he can pull objects, can also be upgraded, and he can learn a number of physics-related techniques.

* Steady Control - By holding the grab and throw buttons at the same time, Hunter can move a held object freely in any direction within his attraction radius.
* Momentum - Works similarlly to the Speed Booster from Metroid. His version of the "shinespark", however, can be steered around.
* Meteor Dive - Converts falling speed into a shockwave upon landing.
* Hammer Toss - By switching directions left and right, inertial force can be stored in the held object to increase horizontal distance and speed when thrown.
* Devour - When holding small enough creatures, the melee attack will make Hunter eat it for health. This does not effect biometals.
