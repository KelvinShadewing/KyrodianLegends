**BIO:**  
A young mercenary in training who was formerly a pirate after being adopted by [Emperor Pendragon](pendragon.md). Midi became an orphan when he was six at the same time he discovered his affinity for bomb magic when his family's car ran off the road into a river. Midi saw a [shadewing](shadewing.md) after escaping the flooding car, and in a panic, cast his first bomb, blasting himself out of the river. His parents were unable to escape from the vehicle and drowned.

He was quickly found by a passenger airship captain named Tempest Firemane, a [gryphon](gryphons.md), and raised as a cabin boy until one night, the ship was attacked by the Cold Front. Captain Firemane challenged [Emperor Pendragon](pendragon.md) to defend his ship, and went missing after being knocked out and falling overboard. Midi attempted to fight Pendragon as well, but rather than let the boy fall as well, Pendragon took him along as part of his loot.

For most of his time in the Cold Front, Midi was mostly treated as just a weapon by many of the pirates, only really making a connection with Pendragon's nephew, [Puck](puck.md), who had also lost his parents. He developed a penchant for snark and puns to help him deal with the abbrasive attitudes of the rest of the Cold Front, in particular that of [Dr. Quincey](drq.md).

He accquired his Transphere while exploring a ruin infested with [biometals](biometals.md) and found a piece of experimental biometal tech that attached itself to him and integrated itself into his tail, allowing him to curl up and cover himself in pillbug armor. Cortex Vespa, the cerebrate of the nest, was thrilled at finally finding a successful bonding of biometal tech and Kyrodian biology, but still attempted to kill Midi for what he knew. After fighting his way out, Midi kept his Transphere a secret from the Cold Front for fear of Dr. Quincey wanting to do further experimentation on him.

**GAMEPLAY:**  
Midi is the most straightforward platformer character. He has lower physical attack power and depends more on his elemental bombs that come in four types:

![Bombs](img/bombs.gif)

* Normal - A pure kineetic explosion that deals damage but does not have an elemental effect. When charged, it can be launched at a greater distance and deals extra damage. This type costs the least amount of energy to use.
* Fire - Adds a burning effect that slowly damages enemies over time. Can also be used to burn down certain plant matter and weaker ice blocks to open passages. When charged, it creates a bigger explosion and deals extra damage.
* Shock - Adds a static effect that causes enemies to pass along an electric charge that damages them when spread, and slows enemies down through paralisys. Electricity can also be used to power conduits and charge machinery. Underwater, the static effect can jump further. When charged, it creates a ball of lightning that lingers and launches lightning bolts at enemies.
* Ice - Adds a freezing effect that stops enemies cold when their health is low. Flying enemies will fall and take damage when frozen, except when under water. When charged, it creates a swirling blizzard that freezes all enemies caught in it, regardless of health (except bosses).
* Dark - Creates a gravity well that pulls in enemies and damages them with intense pressure. Cannot be used normally, but must be built up by taking damage. To prevent accidentally wasting it, it can only be fired as a charged shot.

His bombs can be dispensed in several ways:

* Throwing - The basic attack he starts with. It can be aimed in eight directions, and throws bombs in an arc.
* Charging - Midi has two charge levels. The more he charges, the more damage it'll do, and the bigger the explosion, at the cost of additional energy, and the larger nut being larger and heavier, reducing its thrown range..
* Spinning - When on the ground, pressing down and forward while throwing will instead spin the bomb like a top along the ground, making it much easier to hit enemies that are too low to easily hit by throwing.
* Planting - Midi can have one landmine planted at a time. This is done by holding down while standing and pressing the bomb button. If Midi jumps while standing on a mine, it will explode under him, launching him into the air for a much higher jump.
* Dropping - While in his transphere, Midi will leave a remote or time bomb on the ground. Rapidly dropping and detonating remote bombs will allow limited bomb laddering.

Even when charged, Midi's bombs suffer a speed reduction when under water. A second element can be set to Midi's off hand, similar to Zero's subweapon in the Mega Man Zero games.

![Transphere](img/transphere.gif)

Midi's transphere is basically a morphball, but with two differences to its Metroid counterpart. One, it does not play a spinning animation when stationary, and instead, rolls according to the speed its travelling at. Two, it obeys slopes, and will gain speed depending on the direction of the slope it is on. It can move at the same speeds Midi can while running, but has lower friction because it's a ball.

The explanation of why he does not get dizzy is that because he is not actually spinning himself, only the metal plates around him. His body is gyroscopically stabilized inside. The transphere can be used in biometal nests to quickly travel around through pneumatic tubes.

Midi can accquire a grappling hook as well that can stick to certain surfaces.
