## Chapter 0: The Gryphon Temple

**Synopsis:** An introductory mission where [Midi](midi.md) is sent by the Cold Front to explore an old gryphon ruin. 

----

Upon starting a new game, there is a cutscene that shows scenes from Midi's past along with his narration. If skipped, this narration will appear in his journal to be re-read.

> [Image of a bridge on a rainy night with a small car crossing it.]

> MIDI: My name is Midi Waffle. I was six years old when I found myself alone in the world, the night I lost my parents, when I saw a shadewing, a creature I'd only believed to be a story to scare children, and the night I made my first bomb.

> [Image changes to a younger Midi being held protectively by a large gryphon.]

> MIDI: I was taken in by a kind ship captain named Tempest Firemane. He was good to me, and said he'd let me be part of his crew when I was old enough.

> [Image changes to Firemane and Pendragon dueling on an airship deck.]

> MIDI: That day was stolen from me when the Cold Front came. My new father fought hard but ultimately fell to them.

> [Image shows Midi rushing at Pendragon with a bomb in hand.]

> MIDI: I was no match for their leader, the self-proclaimed Emperor Pendragon. But rather than strike me down, Pendragon saw potential in me, and took me as part of his treasure.

> [Image shows Midi and some pengrunts in an old ruin.]

> MIDI: They raised me to be their treasure hunter, hoping I would grow to be their greatest weapon someday. In fact, I'm about to take on another such mission right now...

An in-game cutscene follows:

> [Cutscene opens with a small, blue aircraft landing on a beach. Midi and three pengrunts disembark, one wearing a black headband, the other two wearing hard hats. They walk up the beach until they reach an old stone ruin.]

> MIDI: Are you sure this is the place? It looks like a real dump to me.

> CAP: Dr. Quincey hasn't been wrong about this stuff yet.

> MIDI: Right, right. So what are we, or rather, am I looking for? Since we know I'm gonna end up doing all the work anyway.

> CAP: We're looking for a tablet with a map on it. It should be further in the ruins somewhere.

> MIDI: Mmhmm. Anything else you can tell me.

> CAP: Just get the tablet back, keep us informed over the radio if anything happens, and don't die. Prioritize in that order.

The player regains control and is free to explore the ruins. Midi starts with neutral bombs. Player can talk to Cap to be told to get on with it, attack the pengrunts to have them retaliate with ice balls, and even attack the dropship with a bomb for an immediate game over.

The ruins entrance has some lightly rocky terrain with fallen pillars and stones to give players an easy place to practice movement. A few pillbugs patrol the upper area with more complex enemies in lower levels. Areas in the ruin will also have some crumbling floors that, if avoided, will reward the player with a vita cell.

Moving deeper in, Midi will find a lift. As he descends for the first time, another journal entry is added.

Further beneath the ruins is the entrance to the biometal nest this chapter focuses on. Midi fights his way through and accquires his transphere from a green pillbug armor that is found in an assembly room that latches onto him and fuses itself to his tail. This allows him to move quickly through small spaces and jump while small.

## Chapter 1: What's Mined is Mine

**Synopsis:** [Midi](midi.md) is an ex pirate who escapes from his old crew and tries to stop them, but is injured. He is rescued by Trey and Sophie, who agree to help defeat the Cold Front. Trey investigates and gives leads to where the CF are heading while Sophie trains Midi and transports him in her airship.

At each dig site, Midi defeats one of Pendragon's commanders, but the CF manage to get away with the four keys they were searching for. Trey discovers the keys are to a vault that holds a weapon of terrible power. The team head out to attack the CF directly.

They assault the Avalanche and critically damage it, forcing a crash landing. Pendragon escapes in a plane with Midi's team in persuit, and they arrive at the vault where Pendragon uses the keys to unlock the weapon just as Midi arrives, where they have their final battle.

After defeating the Cold Front, Midi goes back to his cousin, Rusty's, house, and lets Trey and Sophie know to call him if the CF seem to be causing trouble again. Meanwhile, Dr. Quincey, seeing his leader utterly defeated by a child, takes charge of the Cold Front and swears revenge on Midi, telling the crew he knows of an alternative way to sieze their glory.

----

The episode begins with [Midi](midi.md) aboard the Avalanche. They approach a small mining town, at which point [Dr Quincey](drq.md) calls all [Cold Front](factions.md) members to the hangar for a briefing.

> [Scene begins with an external view of the Avalanche coming in to view, then zooms in to it and switches to an internal view with pengrunts walking through the hall.]

> VO: Attention all hands! Sohcahtoa ahoy. Now approaching the mining town of Goldvein. All hands report to battle stations. Repeat, all hands to battle stations! This is not a drill!

> [The camera stops at a door, then switches to a view of a small, spartan room where Midi is sitting on his bed. He gets up and stretches.]

> MIDI: Well, another day, another unyen, or whatever we're stealing this time.

Player gets control of Midi now. They can explore a portion of the Avalanche with areas that are designed to demonstrate how Midi moves without instructions from text, or they can go directly to the hangar for the next cutscene.

> [Midi arrives in the hangar to find a line of pengrunts waiting at attention. He goes to stand in a corner, doing a "too cool to care" pose. The pengrunts salute as a side door opens and Dr. Quincey enters.]

> DR. Q: Members of ze illustrious Cold Front! Today, ve embark on a mission like no ozher!

> MIDI: We're going to ask nicely this time?

> DR. Q: Ze item ve are seeking zis time is of great importance to our grand leader, Emperor Pendragon; A relic of great value zat vill unlock unlimited power und make us unstoppable.

> MIDI: I think Quincey might'a swallowed part of it already, cuz his mouth is unstoppable.

> DR. Q: I vould not be joking now if I vere you, little tree rat. Lord Pendragon has given me clear instructions zat you are to be kept under close vatch. Iv you vere not so insubordinate, zis vould not be necessary. You vould vell to be more like me und use zed mushy zing you have between your ears!

> MIDI: Hey, I'd happily follow in your footsteps, but I kinda can't, seeing as you never take any.

> DR. Q: Heir Pendragon wishes me to straighten you out by training you in ze field. If it vere up to me, you vould not be going on zis mission at all, boy!

> MIDI: Well you already got your wish, because I'm a short boy. But hey, if you still feel bad, you can hover a little higher and pretend you're taller than me. I won't judge.

> DR. Q: Enough! I have had enough of your sass! You vill stay by my side und do as I say, or so help me, you vill stay in solitary confinement for ze next month!

> MIDI: Be a good boy or go to my room, got it. Relax, doc, I'll behave. Go do your floaty talky thing, kay?

> [Dr. Quincey pauses to take a breath and compose himself, then turns back to the troops.]

> DR. Q: Let me remind you all zat zis mission is top priority. Zere vill not be any lenience as with our previous missions. Zere vill be resistance, und you are all authorized, nein, ordered to use full force to neutralize it!

> MIDI: [frowning] (Full force? Does me mean killing? We've never been told to go all out before...)

> DR. Q: You are to destroy anyvon who gets in your vay. Failure to comply vill not be tolerated und vill be seen as treason against ze Emperor.

> [The pengrunts salute and sound off. Quincey nods.]

> DR. Q: Good. Zen prepare for deployment! Air unite, launch immediately und disable ze anti-air defenses for ze Avalanche to land. Ground forces, make sure your mana reservees are fully charged for assault! Und skvirrel!

> [Midi stands up normally at attention.]

> DR. Q: You vill avait my orders to begin your assault. You vill provide counter battery cover for ze ground units. Understood?

> MIDI: [salutes] You vole!

> DR. Q: *grunt* Do not let ze Emperor down! For ze glory of ze Cold Front! Deploy!

> [The bay doors open and the planes in the background start up. Scene goes to the outside to show them flying through the sky over the town and start attacking. Cut to ground forces firing up at the sky, some getting hit and falling to the ground. Cut to close up side view of Midi watching. His face shows horror at the brutality, then goes into a grimace. The camera pans down to his hand which clenches into a fist and starts charging energy. Cut back to normal game view.]

> MIDI: (I've had enough of this.)

> DR. Q: Vaffle! Vat are you doing!

> MIDI: What I should have done when I first got here!

> [Midi shoots a bomb which Dr. Quincey counters with a lightning bolt from his hoverchair. The explosion knocks Midi out of the ship.]

> DR. Q: No! Blast it!

> MIDI: I just diiiiiid!

> DR. Q: Ze bomber has betrayed us! Begin landing sequence immediately und persue! Terminate vith extreme prejudice!
