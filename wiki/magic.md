# Magic

Magic in Kyrodian Legends is defined as the process in which mana, a psycho-reactive energy, is manipulated by the will of the user to perform tasks and act upon the physical world. To understand how it works, one must first know about the fourth dimension. In KL, the fourth dimension is not time, but another dimension of space itself. Matter and energy that do not overlap on this fourth dimension is capable of phasing through each other within normal three dimensional space. The scale used to measure and represent the fourth dimensional position and width of a given matter type is known as the 4th spectrum.

Because mana is slightly out of phase, only partially overlapping physical matter on the 4th spectrum, and is capable of temporarily moving further away, it can be instructed to do things that appear to break the laws of three dimensional physics. In fact, any matter can have its position changed on the 4th spectrum, but will always attempt to return to its natural position, called the 4th rest, requiring constant energy to be exerted to maintain an altered phase.

When a mage casts a spell, their brain translates their will into an electronic signal that the mana in their body will react to, similar to the electronic signals that tell the muscles when and how to move. After completing its task, the mana will return to a resting state, at which point it can be reabsorbed by living beings. Areas with high concentrations of mana can be beneficial to mages who have learned to draw it in on command. This is done by willing the mana in their bodies to compress, creating a void that pulls ambient energy in like a vacuum. However, this can have harmful effects if too much is drawn in at once, as once the compression stops, the mana will attempt to spread out within its new host, and may damage them by leaking out.

The effect of damaging a mage who charges too much is due to the fact that the mana has not had time to acclimate to its new host; it's frequency has not yet changed to match the signature of the host's aura. Mana that is absorbed naturally over time will perfectly resonate with the aura, allowing the caster to cast spells without harming themselves at all. For instance, Midi is able to be caught in his own explosions becaues the mana creating his bombs matches his aura.

Enchanting is the process of ordering mana to take on a new host and use the stored energy their to perform a persistent task. Because enchanted objects are wrapped in a magical aura, they are capable of interacting with ethereal entities, which is why, for example, an enchanted sword is needed to fight a ghost.

## Elements

Elemental magic comes in eight forms, half of which representing forms of matter, and the other half representing forms of energy.

|Matter|Energy|
|------|------|
|Earth |Fire  |
|Water |Ice   |
|Air   |Shock |
|Dark  |Light |

Mages with elemental skill tend to lean towards one or the other type, matter or energy. However, this is where the yin-yang principal comes into play. A mage who specializes in energy will have one matter element they can use, and one who specializes in matter will have one energy element. For example, [Midi](midi.md) can use fire, ice, and shock bombs, and can also make dark bombs that create a gravity well.

Along with that, another point of balance among the elements is how they relate to their compliments. Each elemental category has two elements that counteract each other, and two that counteract one from the other category.These elements will have a greater effect against their counterpart, while offering resistance against themselves.

|Element|Counter|
|-------|-------|
|Fire   |Ice    |
|Earth  |Air    |
|Water  |Shock  |
|Light  |Dark   |

Conjuration in magic does not produce real matter, only an approximation of it. When a conjured object runs out of energy, either over time or bieng depleted by damage, it will disintegrate. Conjured items must be given a constant charge in order to remain indefinitely, and will cause the caster to slowly deplete mana over time, or faster if the object is more massive. For this reason, conjured food should not be consumed for sustinance, as it will simply disappear afterwards, leaving whoever ate it hungry again with no benefit. This rule does not apply to summoned objects, as that is merely a change in position, and not a creation of pseudomatter.

## Psionics

On rare occasions, a person will be born able to learn psionic abilities instead of magic. Psi, the energy used in psionics, does not share a 4th space with mana, but does with physical matter, meaning the two energies do not have any effect on one another and must use some physical means in order to affect each other. Because of the 4th distance from mana, psionics are virtually useless against ethereal beings, making psychic types not very effective against ghosts.

Despite common belief, having psionic abilities does not automatically grant one telepathy, mind reading, or mind control. While it is possible to learn telepathy fairly easy, in order to read minds, the user would first have to learn to sense and understand brain waves, which for non-telepaths, have an extremely short emission range. It works like a radio; if one is not actually transmitting, the other cannot recieve anything. Physical contact is necessary to read minds psionically without the one being read being a telepath. In fact, it is actually those recieving telepathic messages who are reading the mind of the psychic.

Mind control is even more complicated, requiring the user to have an intimate understanding of the subject's thought process in order to get the desired result, otherwise, it would be like pushing buttons without knowing what they do. Most psychics, at best, are able to learn empathic compulsion, projecting their emotions or memories of emotions onto others.

[Shadewings](shadewings.md) are all born with psionic abilities.

## Aura

A lifeform's spiritual aura acts as a natural barrier and means of healing quickly. It activates automatically when it senses the body is in danger of physical damage, shrowding the body in a force field and working to heal any damage done to the body by spending energy to replace lost or damaged cells.

Aura can regenerate over time when the body absorbs and metabolizes ambient energy, and can be sped up by taking in substances that benefit the body, such as food, medicine, or alchemical stimulants, or healing spells which trigger the aura to metabolize mana directly. Fighters who have lost a lot can be seen eating copious amounts of food without increasing their size as the aura converts the material into spiritual energy.

Like with mana, aura has a different position on the 4th spectrum, and shifts its position to enter the physical plane to deflect damage. According to the law of conservation, the ammount of food required to restore certain quantities of aura should contain enough energy to create several megaton blasts. However, aura spends energy not just on deflecting damage, but also holding its position and fighting against the pull towards its 4th rest. Therefore, it cannot return an equal amount of energy to what it takes in, as a portion of that energy goes elsewhere.

Because it overlaps with mana, magical detectors can be made to measure it and present it in a quantified form of points known as vita (singular, vitum). A person can wear a special wristband that lets them gauge exactly how much vita they have. When it runs out, the aura can no longer protect the body, leaving it vulnerable.

Wearing armor can allow the aura to relax, saving energy as it doesn not need to try as hard to protect areas of the body where the armor takes the hit. Some fighters still prefer not to wear armor to maximize their mobility.

Since aura only activates when the body is in danger, certain forms of "damage" can circumvent it. For example, a surgeon with no intent to harm will be able to use a scalpel or needle to treat a patient, and someone smacking someone outside of a fight (usually in comedic scenes) will not be hindered at all, especially when such strikes are meant to convey a message that would otherwise not sink in, like smacking an insubordinate underling.

Because souls in KL are capable of inhabiting any body with the capacity for sapience, even machines may potentially develop them, allowing them to have auras as well.

## Fortes

A magic forte grants mages with a special aptitude towards a certain type or class of spells, or a grant a passive ability. Some mages may have two, but three has never been recorded. The rigidness of the affinity dictates both the effectiveness of the spells it grants, and the limitations of how much a mage can learn beyond it.

For example, Midi's forte grants him his elemental bombs, and his passive tailsafe. However, due to having two rigid fortes, he is unable to learn any other type of magic.

## "Tric" Weapons

A slang shortening for "thaumaturgic", tric weapons do not carry their own enchantment, but instead rely on the magic of their weilder for power. This allows for virtually unlimited use; if the user keeps regenerating mana, they can keep channeling it into a tric weapon. Such arms are able to siphon mana easily enough on their own that no magical skill is required to use them, simply a supply of energy.

Two common uses for such technology include the tric shot, a pistol that turns the weilder's mana into bullets, and the tric blade, which turns mana into a sword of energy. Depending on the user, such weapons can take on elemental effects, or other spell effects entirely. Someone with a forte for light magic, for instance, would shoot bullets of light from a tric shot, while a healer could pump a healing spell into it to create a healing bullet.

Some fortes are incompatible with certain tric weapons, and will thus confer no special effects.

Various examples of tric weapons include:

* Shot - A basic pistol that fires medium-range bullets.
* Sniper - Concentrates its bullets into a thin laser for extra precision and range.
* Buster - An arm-mounted tric shot that can charge up large bursts.
* Grenade - Turns mana charges into impact bombs. Midi's magic is an in-born and more complex version of this.
* Sword - A basic melee weapon, blade length depends on the power output of the wielder.
* Whip - A flexible beam weapon that can grapple.
* Shield - Acts as both a physical shield and magic ward. Can reflect small destruction spells.
* Pickaxe - Used by miners to augment digging ability and break through stone with less physical effort.

## Goats

Kyrodian goats are unique and mystical creatures that regularly defy the laws of physics in ways that even arch mages have been unable to define. They are reportedly capable of ingesting and metabolizing any material, even solid metal. Despite these awesome powers, they are quite gentle and friendly, though shadewings seem to have an irrational fear of them.

Some goats have been known to reshape themselves into an anthropomorphic form and speak to people. It is exceptionally rare that this happens, but the few that have been seen doing it have gone on record to say that they can all do it; they mostly just prefer the simple life and to be left alone. Although goats have been involved in some of Kyroda's most significant historical events, they prefer to be left out, as they don't care for fame.
