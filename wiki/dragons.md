# Dragons

The life cycle of a dragon is divided into two distinct stages. During the first portion of their lives, they are bipedal, and are around the average height of 7 or 8 feet. Around age 50, they will start growing large wings and become too heavy to walk upright, beginning their second stage where, after their remaining friends have passed on, they return to the flights they are born into.

During this period, they travel the world, learning as much as they can. Due to their long lifespans, ability to fly great distances without mechanical aid, and strongest connection to [magic](magic.md) of all races, dragons believe themselves to be responsible for preserving the knowledge and posterity of Kyroda. Some will also work as miners and treasure hunters to ensure they have the funds they need to collect and preserve information, as well as to fund younger dragons just starting out on their own to help them get started.

Dragons are covered in extremely durable scales, and can have manes, spikes, horns, or fins going down their back. Along with their virtually unlimited color variations, there's no practical limit to how varied they look. While rare, it is still possible for them too have feathered wings instead of membraned.

During the biped stage, they will live in whatever dwellings suit their tastes and among any people that happen to be around. They leave their nests at a young age with enough treasure to last them a bit whike they seek employment and homes.

Dragon libraries are where they store their accumulated knowledge. While their material treasure hoard makes them wealthy among the smaller people, among other dragons, knowledge is the true wealth, and it is one they both share freely and protect fiercely. A thief stealing gold will be shrugged off and left to the authorities, but anyone found stealing ir willfully destroying their books will be reminded of the myths spread about them during the Feudal era of dragons devouring princesses shortly before the offender is drafted for a reenactment in the role of said princess.

## The Lunar Library

After the Biometal War, the dragons made a pact to prepare for the worst case scenario: the fall of Kyrodian culture altogether. They constructed a portal of such immense magical requirement that only a dragon can open it, one leading to the moon itself, whereupon they constructed a library that would hold a copy of every significant book, article, and historical record within the airless building. The vaccuum of space itself would be used to preserve Kyroda's knowledge so that if the [biometals](biometals.md) should ever return and be victorious, they would launch the library into space for other civilizations to discover.

With the invention of electronic media, digital versions of stored books were put into production. An entire wing of the library is dedicated to storing miles and miles of data tapes. These tapes also include significant audio and video documents.
