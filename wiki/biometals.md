# Biometals

Biometals are a techno-organic race. They are made entirely of machinery and electronics, but function identically to organic life, eating metal to grow and reproduce, drinking water to produce energy, and living in ways that match the various organic species they resemble.

Most biometals are non-sapient, and behave like animals. They are connected to their sapient counterparts, known as cerebrates, who can issue commands to their underlings. Cerebrates resemble anthropomorphic versions of the biometals they command.

## Characters

The cerebrates encountered by Midi have nicknames given by him. They are not planned to be recurring characters, and so do not have articles of their own.

* Cortex Vespa (Queen Brain) - A queen bee commanding a nest of insect-like biometals. She engages in experimentation on integrating biometal and Kyrodian biologies, purely out of her own curiosity. Few of her subjects survive the experiments. [Midi Waffle](midi.md) is the only one to escape from her after surviving integration with pillbug armor, granting him what he calls his transphere.

* Hurricane Seagull (Stormy Gull) - A seagull commanding an oceanic airforce. His forces are carried by an enormous whale biometal which swallows ships whole for materials.

* Artisan Nezumi (Paint Brux) - A mouse with a brush tail. The paints he applies to surfaces changes their properties, similar to the gels from Portal 2.

* Rapid Wilddog (Trigger Happyena) - A hyena with wrist-mounted uzis, shoulder-mounted gatlings, and a third uzi on the tail. He takes to the name Midi gives him, thinking it describes him perfectly.

* Scrap Goat (Capri Crunch) - A goat with a ravenous appetite for metal. He uses it to make himself bigger and heavier to create shockwaves by jumping, and can also cough the metal back up for a projectile attack.

* Venomous Anubis (Sick Puppy) - A jackal who uses toxins and acids. Midi was going to give her another name, but was cut off before he could finish it. "Hey, I got a name for you. How about 'Toxic Bi--' Yikes! Alright, how about Sick Puppy?"
