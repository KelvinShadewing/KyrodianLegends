# Overworld

This mode is used for towns. It uses an overhead view with graphics resembling Pokemon FRLG/RSE. The main reason to have this viewpoint is because, in my experience, navigating a town in a platformer view is exhausting and one-dimensional, and having branching roads can make it easy to get lost.

The towns will serve as points where players can find quests and learn some lore of the world by interacting with people. Job boards offer lists of missions the player can take, but some will only show up when certain conditions are met.
