## The Cults of Yusarr and Loper

Kyroda's most well-known religion focuses on Yusarr, the spirit of heroism. Yusarrists believe that Loper, the devil of their theology, is responsible for much of the world's conflicts, creating periods of strife and chaos, and that Yusarr will select a hero as their avatar. Avatars of Yusarr are said to be gifted with inordinate fortune so long as they follow the path of Yusarr and use such fortunes for the benefit of others, and are even gifted with premonitions of their own imminent defeats so that they may figure out how to avoid them.

Loperists, however, believe Yusarr to be a hedonistic bully, and that Loper creates lesser evils to keep the attention of Yusarr so that they do not turn their thirst for combat and glory into conquest. According to the word of Loper, if Yusarr is left unquenched with a suitable challenge, they will instead elect for their avatar to be the villain instead of the hero. The cultists believe the often systematic path design of biometals to not be simply something adventurers have learned to navigate naturally, but were arranged as such purposefully by Loper to keep Yusarr busy.
