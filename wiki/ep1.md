&nbsp;

*All cutscenes are skippable by pressing start. A menu will ask if the player would like to skip in case they press it by accident.*

The episode begins with [Midi](midi.md) aboard the Avalanche. They approach a small mining town, at which point [Dr Quincey](drq.md) calls all [Cold Front](factions.md) members to the hangar for a briefing.

> [Scene begins with an external view of the Avalanche coming in to view, then zooms in to it and switches to an internal view with pengrunts walking through the hall.]

> VO: Attention all hands! Sohcahtoa ahoy. Now approaching the mining town of Goldvein. All hands report to battle stations. Repeat, all hands to battle stations! This is not a drill!

> [The camera stops at a door, then switches to a view of a small, spartan room where Midi is sitting on his bed. He gets up and stretches.]

> MIDI: Well, another day, another unyen, or whatever we're stealing this time.

Player gets control of Midi now. They can explore a portion of the Avalanche with areas that are designed to demonstrate how Midi moves without instructions from text, or they can go directly to the hangar for the next cutscene.

> [Midi arrives in the hangar to find a line of pengrunts waiting at attention. He goes to stand in a corner, doing a "too cool to care" pose. The pengrunts salute as a side door opens and Dr. Quincey enters.]

> DR. Q: Members of ze illustrious Cold Front! Today, ve embark on a mission like no ozher!

> MIDI: We're going to ask nicely this time?

> DR. Q: Ze item ve are seeking zis time is of great importance to our grand leader, Emperor Pendragon; A relic of great value zat vill unlock unlimited power und make us unstoppable.

> MIDI: I think Quincey might'a swallowed part of it already, cuz his mouth is unstoppable.

> DR. Q: I vould not be joking now if I vere you, little tree rat. Lord Pendragon has given me clear instructions zat you are to be kept under close vatch. Iv you vere not so insubordinate, zis vould not be necessary. You vould vell to be more like me und use zed mushy zing you have between your ears!

> MIDI: Hey, I'd happily follow in your footsteps, but I kinda can't, seeing as you never take any.

> DR. Q: Heir Pendragon wishes me to straighten you out by training you in ze field. If it vere up to me, you vould not be going on zis mission at all, boy!

> MIDI: Well you already got your wish, because I'm a short boy. But hey, if you still feel bad, you can hover a little higher and pretend you're taller than me. I won't judge.

> DR. Q: Enough! I have had enough of your sass! You vill stay by my side und do as I say, or so help me, you vill stay in solitary confinement for ze next month!

> MIDI: Be a good boy or go to my room, got it. Relax, doc, I'll behave. Go do your floaty talky thing, kay?

> [Dr. Quincey pauses to take a breath and compose himself, then turns back to the troops.]

> DR. Q: Let me remind you all zat zis mission is top priority. Zere vill not be any lenience as with our previous missions. Zere vill be resistance, und you are all authorized, nein, ordered to use full force to neutralize it!

> MIDI: [frowning] (Full force? Does me mean killing? We've never been told to go all out before...)

> DR. Q: You are to destroy anyvon who gets in your vay. Failure to comply vill not be tolerated und vill be seen as treason against ze Emperor.

> [The pengrunts salute and sound off. Quincey nods.]

> DR. Q: Good. Zen prepare for deployment! Air unite, launch immediately und disable ze anti-air defenses for ze Avalanche to land. Ground forces, make sure your mana reservees are fully charged for assault! Und skvirrel!

> [Midi stands up normally at attention.]

> DR. Q: You vill avait my orders to begin your assault. You vill provide counter battery cover for ze ground units. Understood?

> MIDI: [salutes] You vole!

> DR. Q: *grunt* Do not let ze Emperor down! For ze glory of ze Cold Front! Deploy!

> [The bay doors open and the planes in the background start up. Scene goes to the outside to show them flying through the sky over the town and start attacking. Cut to ground forces firing up at the sky, some getting hit and falling to the ground. Cut to close up side view of Midi watching. His face shows horror at the brutality, then goes into a grimace. The camera pans down to his hand which clenches into a fist and starts charging energy. Cut back to normal game view.]

> MIDI: (I've had enough of this.)

> DR. Q: Vaffle! Vat are you doing!

> MIDI: What I should have done when I first got here!

> [Midi shoots a bomb which Dr. Quincey counters with a lightning bolt from his hoverchair. The explosion knocks Midi out of the ship.]

> DR. Q: No! Blast it!

> MIDI: I just diiiiiid!

> DR. Q: Ze bomber has betrayed us! Begin landing sequence immediately und persue! Terminate vith extreme prejudice!
