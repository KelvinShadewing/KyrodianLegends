**BIO:**  
Sophie is [Trey](trey.md)'s twin sister. Like her brother, she was born with [vampiric](vampires.md) powers. She is able to transfer energy through touch, allowing her to siphon magic and move it between herself and any object she's holding. She uses this to power her cry-pistols, one of which can be reconfigured and attached to the other to combine them into a sniper rifle.

Unlike Trey, Sophie didn't allow the abuse from her parents to make her distant or aloof. Instead, she chose to be as warm and caring as she could in an effort to be the exact opposite of what her parents were. She also developed an interest in machines, and eventually became both pilot and mechanic when she and Trey bought their own airship.

**GAMEPLAY:**  
She's currently just planned to be Midi's transportation interface for the time being, but I've had the idea of an episode featuring her rescuing him from capture, or even tagging along as an AI partner in some missions.
