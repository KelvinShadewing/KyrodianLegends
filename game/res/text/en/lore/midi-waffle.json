					"title" : "Introduction",
					"content" : "  My name is Midi Waffle. I was six years old when I found myself alone in the world, the night I lost my parents, when I saw a shadewing, a creature I'd only believed to be a story to scare children, and the night I made my first bomb.\n\n  I was taken in by a kind ship captain named Tempest Firemane. He was good to me, and said he'd let me be part of his crew when I was old enough.\n\n  That day was stolen from me when the Cold Front came. My new father fought hard but ultimately fell to them. I was no match for their leader, the self-proclaimed Emperor Pendragon. But rather than strike me down, Pendragon saw potential in me, and took me as part of his treasure.\n\n  They raised me to be their treasure hunter, hoping I would grow to be their greatest weapon someday. In fact, I'm about to take on another such mission right now..."

				"first-lift" : {
					"title" : "Gryphon Temple Descent",
					"content" : "  I actually enjoy these treasure hunts. I don't care about the pirates getting their precious treasure, but I love exploring these old places. As soon as I'm strong enough, I'm gonna blow this place and find myself a real adventure."
				},
				"biometal-nest" : {
					"title" : "Biometal Nest",
					"content" : "  Figures there'd be a biometal nest down here, and figures I'd be the one to have to deal with them. I wonder if those blunt-beaked grunts knew... Either way, I'm stuck here now. I don't have any tech on me they'd want, but that won't stop them from attacking me just for being here. At least I'd be doing the world a favor by clearing this place out."
				},
				"transphere" : {
					"title" : "Transphere",
					"content" : "  This weird metal ball thing just stuck itself to me! I thought it was a sleeping pillbug, but when I touched it, it sprang to life and jumped on me, then disappeared into my tailsafe. The weird part is that it makes a shell around me when I curl up, and I can still move by rolling. I need a cool name for this thing. Transforming into a sphere... Heh, I'll call it the transphere.\n\n  Yes, I write out my laughs. Don't judge me."
				},
				"second-lift" : {
					"title" : "Another Explorer?",
					"content" : "  Seems like someone got here before us. What happened to them? Probably the biometals got them. If there's any more journal pages, I should find them. Maybe someday, I'll be able to tell someone what happened."
				},
				"new-bomb" : {
					"title" : "New Bomb",
					"content" : "  So I just learned a new type of bomb. Neat. I'm not sure why it took me this long to figure out anything beyond the basic ones. Something about fighting that thing, feeling its attacks, it just made something click. Maybe I'll learn more elements by fighting other types of enemies. This just might be my ticket out of this crew!"
				},
				"dark-bomb" : {
					"title" : "Dark Bomb",
					"content" : "  So this new bomb... this one actually kind of scares me. It doesn't recharge normally, but gets stronger when I get hurt. I don't have any control over when it's fully charged, and when it is, I feel like I NEED to get rid of it. If it shows up at the wrong time, I guarantee Dr. Quincey is gonna lock me up and do anything to figure out how to weaponize it.\n\n  I wouldn't put it past that creep to try to turn me into a living cannon or something. My bombs are all I'm good for to that guy, and probably to Pendragon, too. If I keep anything I find down here a secret from them, it definitely better be this."
				},
				"strange-tablet" : {
					"title" : "Strange Tablet",
					"content" : "  So I found this weird stone tablet with what looks like a map on it. I think this is what they wanted me to find. There's definitely something important about the places marked on it.\n\n  There's no way I'm letting these guys find everything on this map. I've copied it into my own journal. As for the tablet, I broke it in half and shattered one. This way, I can keep the important stuff to myself without coming back empty handed. Hopefully that'll keep them from getting suspicious."
				},
				"island-destruction" : {
					"title" : "Gullsandur Destroyed",
					"content" : "  The whole island blew up! After I beat that big queen bee-looking thing, everything started going crazy! I was able to escape in time, but everything left there is gone now. A good excuse as any for only coming back with half the map.\n\n Come to think of it, I should have dropped the other half on the way out if the place was gonna blow up. But give me a break. It's kinda hard to think about that when you're running out of a collapsing biometal nest.\n\n  I hope I got all of the professor's notes. As soon as I'm out of this crew, I'm gonna find the university he worked at and tell them what happened.\n\n  With these new bombs I've learned and the equipment I found down there, I honestly feel ready to set out on my own. I just need the right opportunity to ditch these guys. After that, who knows? Maybe I'll be an archaeologist like Prof. Banyan. I still enjoy exploring old ruins, and there's plenty to go around thanks to the Biometal War.\n\n  I'll turn in the tablet once we get back to the Avalanche, and from there, I just gotta keep my head down until the right time. I've got a feeling that time is soon."
