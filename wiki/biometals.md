# Biometals

Biometals are a techno-organic race. They are made entirely of machinery and electronics, but function identically to organic life, eating metal to grow and reproduce, drinking water to produce energy, and living in ways that match the various organic species they resemble.

Most biometals are non-sapient, and behave like animals. They are connected to their sapient counterparts, known as cerebrates, who can issue commands to their underlings. Cerebrates resemble anthropomorphic versions of the biometals they command.

## Biometal War

Over a century before the events of the first game, Kyroda was invaded by biometals from space. The war went on for over a decade, and ended with the alliance of all of Kyroda's races. The cerebrates, special biometals capable of controlling their non-sapient cousins, were either destroyed or driven off world by Kyroda's unified forces. The remaining biometals now roam the planet as wild animals, and are a constant source of conflict for Kyrodians.

## Characters

The cerebrates encountered by Midi have nicknames given by him. They are not planned to be recurring characters, and so do not have articles of their own.

* Cortex Vespa (Queen Brain) - A queen bee commanding a nest of insect-like biometals. She engages in experimentation on integrating biometal and Kyrodian biologies, purely out of her own curiosity. Few of her subjects survive the experiments. [Midi Waffle](midi.md) is the only one to escape from her after surviving integration with pillbug armor, granting him what he calls his transphere.

* Hurricane Seagull (Stormy Gull) - A seagull commanding an oceanic airforce. His forces are carried by an enormous whale biometal which swallows ships whole for materials.

* Artisan Nezumi (Paint Brux) - A mouse with a brush tail. The paints he applies to surfaces changes their properties, similar to the gels from Portal 2.

* Rapid Wilddog (Trigger Happyena) - A hyena with wrist-mounted uzis, shoulder-mounted gatlings, and a third uzi on the tail. He takes to the name Midi gives him, thinking it describes him perfectly.

* Scrap Goat (Capri Crunch) - A goat with a ravenous appetite for metal. He uses it to make himself bigger and heavier to create shockwaves by jumping, and can also cough the metal back up for a projectile attack.

* Venomous Anubis (Sick Puppy) - A jackal who uses toxins and acids. Midi was going to give her another name, but was cut off by an acid attack before he could finish it. "Hey, I got a name for you. How about 'Toxic Bi--' Yikes! Alright, how about Sick Puppy?"


## Omicron ((SPOILER WARNING))

Centuries before Kyrodian Legends takes place, biometals were invented on Earth by humans. Human kind was still divided in many ways, and even the creation of truly sapient artificial life was not enough to change their ways.

Omicron was created as a problem solver, and tasked with finding a solution to unite humanity without infringing on free will. After analyzing human psychology and history, Omicron came to the conclusion that the only thing that could truly keep humans in harmony with each other was a common enemy. With this in mind, he created a program to infect other biometals and turn them to his cause, instigating a war on humanity.

The plan ended up being a complete success. Seeing this, Omicron decided he could do the same for the rest of the galaxy, and created seed ships to spread biometals across space. These ships carried miners and hatchers that would propagate biometals on whatever world they landed on, where they would then seek out conflicts to interfere with and create new seed ships to further spread.

Biometals do not fight to the point of genocide. They only make themselves enough of a threat to unite whatever worlds they land on, while at the same time systematically assimilating and destroying much of the world's technology to ensure they cannot be exterminated themselves. Once unity is achieved, they leave behind minimal forces to continue the conflict and ensure mass war never breaks out again, while at the same time keeping up the appearance of their own power being kept in check by the locals.

In some instances, biometals will allow the creation of weapons that appear to be much stronger than they really are, and feign defeat as a means of gaslighting the population into thinking they've become more powerful than they really are.
