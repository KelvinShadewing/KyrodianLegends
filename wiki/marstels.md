# Marstels

Marstels are the mustelid-like race. They share physical features of raccoons and otters, with small, semi-round ears, partial webbing on the hands and feet, and a tail that is strong enough to aid in swimming. They are fast swimmers and can hold their breaths longer than others on average. Colorations of various mustelids can be found on them, including raccoons, otters, badgers, ferrets, skunks, meerkats, red pandas, as well as other solid colors. Average height is around five feet, with the rare giant reaching nine.

Due to their semi-aquatic lifestyles, their agriculture leans towards wetland farming, and they also do a lot of fishing. Their architecture uses a lot of adobe and fired clay, making it look like a mix of Mexican and Japanese themes. Some homes are partially submerged in clear lakes, a holdover design from the Feudal and Biometal War eras where marstels needed to sneak past enemies and use hidden entrances to get into their homes.

They have learned to harness living coral as [thaumatic generators](magic.md), allowing them to magically reinforce glass to create undersea domes with towns built on terraces of older dead coral shelves. Those that learn hydromancy can shoot like a torpedo through water as well.
