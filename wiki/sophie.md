**BIO:**  
Sophie is [Trey](trey.md)'s twin sister. Like her brother, she was born with [vampiric](vampires.md) powers. She is able to transfer energy through touch, allowing her to siphon magic and move it between herself and any object she's holding. She uses this to power her cry-pistols, one of which can be reconfigured and attached to the other to combine them into a sniper rifle.

Unlike Trey, Sophie didn't allow the abuse from her parents to make her distant or aloof. Instead, she chose to be as warm and caring as she could in an effort to be the exact opposite of what her parents were. She also developed an interest in machines, and eventually became both pilot and mechanic when she and Trey bought their own airship.

**GAMEPLAY:**  
She's currently just planned to be Midi's transportation interface for the time being, but I've had the idea of an episode featuring her rescuing him from capture, or even tagging along as an AI partner in some missions. In others, she acts as a sniper, offering cover fire and helping to fight enemies that may be out of the others' reach.

Possible gameplay would have her using her dual pistols as her main ranged attack, while holding the tertiary button would put her into sniper mode, having the camera move her to the edge of the screen to see further away and project a line from her to precisely aim at targets. A reticle would also appear and move around similar to a mouse cursor, but the line will be present to make aiming easier without having to move the reticle all the way to the target.
