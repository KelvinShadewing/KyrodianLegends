**FULL NAME:** Trey Julian Mendez  
**RACE:** [Marstel](marstels.md)  
**SEX:** Male  
**AGE:** 18  
**HEIGHT:** 5'1"  
**WEIGHT:** ...  
**COLORS:** Dark gray fur, light gray underfur, green eyes  
**FACTION:** Cloud Chasers

**BIO:**  
Like his sister, [Sophie](sophie.md), Trey was mistreated by his parents as a child and ended up running away from home with her. They did not know at the time, but Trey's mother had been infected by a [vampire](vampires.md). While she was cured in time, her unborn children were not, and ended up being born as demivamps.

Trey took to mercenary life early in order to get by. Growing up in a small town, and only having other small towns nearby to seek work in, much of Trey's time was spent fighting scavengers and bandits. Some jobs required him to retrieve stolen goods, causing him to learn thievery techniques himself. His affinity for shadow bending aided his stealth and allowed him to learn how to deal with enemies indirectly, and in some cases, entirely non-violently. He still chose to practice close combat, as he knew not every fight could be hidden or run away from.

He and Sophie eventually managed to purchase their own airship, allowing them to finally escape the region they were born in. Trey still harbors a grudge against those that steal from the helpless, and while he can somewhat understand the lifestyle of scavengers, he despises bandits and pirates.

**GAMEPLAY:**  
Trey is mainly a stealth character whose power is affected by light. When in the dark, his magic attacks cost less energy, and he is more difficult to be detected by enemies. His play style also borrows some from Castlevania, using a shadow whip as part of his melee combo, and being able to throw shadow kunai in eight directions. When charged, he will throw a boomerang instead of a kunai.

By destroying light sources, he can keep himself safer from enemies and increase his magic efficiency. Certain light sources, such as windows, cannot be disabled in some cases, such as ones without curtains.

Unlike Midi, who gains new attacks as he progresses, Trey focuses on mobility upgrades. Upgrades he can accquire include:

* Double Jump - Trey conjures a pair of shadowy wings to boost his height. To avoid breaking the level design, double jumps will not be recharged by wall kicking.
* Fog Dash - Trey becomes a black cloud and rushes forward, allowing him to pass through grates and other permeable objects.
* Bat Form - Drains energy over time, but allows free movement through the air. If he is in a place that is too small to transform back into, he will remain a bat even after his energy has run out, but it will not start to recharge until he finds an open space to turn back.
* Black Wind - Functions like the speed booster in Metroid, but does not have a shinespark equivalent. Instead, momentum is preserved by wall jumping fast enough for vertical movement.
