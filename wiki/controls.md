# Controls

The game's controls will be limited to what can be done with a six-button pad to ensure compatibility with many controllers as well as enough room for every character's actions. The default controls shown here use the Pandora pad as an example.

## Default Controls

* start: submenu
* select: change character (one player)/join partner (two player)
* A: melee attack
* X: jump
* Y: primary(P) special
* B: secondary(S) special
* R: tertiary(T) special
* L: backdash

## Character Specific Controls

**Midi**
P: acorn bomb
S: transphere 
T: cycle element

In transphere mode, the backdash button activates Midi's magnet field after he gets it, letting him ride on magnetic rails.

**Trey**
P: shadow kunai
S: grappling whip
T: dark shift (hold)

**Sophie**
P: blaster (rapid)
S: blaster (charge)
T: sniper mode (hold)

**Hunter**
P: throw/punt
S: attract/grab
T: extrasensory

## Notes

I've considered campaigns and side modes that would allow for two-player co-op, but so far, only the episode planned for Trey and Sophie will have room for this. I may have Midi return as a playable partner in Hunter's story, though.
