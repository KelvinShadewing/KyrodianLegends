# **HISTORY**

Kyroda's recorded history is divided into four eras. More info will be added to these as I come up with it.

## Feudal Era

Recorded history begins with only vague accounts of this era due to a lack of emphasis on intellectual pursuits. During this time, the races of Kyroda were at odds with one another, even with the likes of [kholu](kholu.md) and [humans](humans.md) being hunted as prey by others.

## Biometal War

This era began when the biometal army descended from space with the intention of siezing the planet's resources and assimilating Kyroda's rare magical minerals to enhance their own abilities. The war spurred truces, and then cooperation, between the races, forcing them to band together to defend their world from the invading machines. During this time, Kyroda's great wonders, the haven cities, were founded as bastions against the biometals.

At the end of the war, the surviving biometal cerebrates retreated from the planet, leaving their forces to live like mindless animals on the planet's surface.

## Reconstruction

The shortest completed era. During this time, new laws and treaties were put in place to ensure lasting peace and alliances to keep the world prepared in case the biometals ever returned. The haven cities were repurposed into bustling metropolises, and borders between nations were opened to foster interracial relations. Much of Kyroda's non-military inventions happened here as well thanks to the cooperation between peoples enabling trade and industry to make new creations possible.

## Stability

The current era the games take place in.
