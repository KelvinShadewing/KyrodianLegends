**BIO:**

Dr. Quincey, sometimes called Dr. Q for short, is the Cold Front's scientist. He is apt in many fields of science, including technology, bio engineering, magitech, aerodynamics, and chemistry. Dr. Q designed the CF fighter planes to use special belt-driven propellers to allow hovering and make the propellers impossible to jam, as well as his own jet engine to make them faster than any other craft, barring special issue military planes.

Dr. Q is a former Apex scientist. After discovering top secret documents about [Project Shadewing](shadewings.md), the company attempted to end his life to keep their secret. [Pendragon's](pendragon.md) Black Ice Corps found and rescued him, taking him to the CF to induct him. He gladly accepted their aid in exchange for working for them full time, especially since Pendragon showed great patience with his developments, allowing Quincey to work at his own pace and not be pressured for results every day.

However, the attempt on his life left him paralyzed from the waist down, permanently taking away his ability to walk. To deal with this, he created a hover chair using a levitite framework similar to how airships are constructed, and over time, weaponized his chair, equipping it with high-powered electrodes capable of firing arcs of lightning, and special missiles that could track a target based on its [thaumatic](magic.md) signature. When up close and personal, the chair's bumper can curve outward like a snap bracelet and lock around an opponent, then send massive charges of electricity into them. The chair is powered by a nuclear diamond battery he was developing during his time at Apex, a larger version of which was given to Pendragon to power the Avalanche.
