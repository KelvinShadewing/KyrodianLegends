**BIO:**

Rusty is Midi's long-lost cousin. After hearing about the death of [Midi's](midi.md) parents, he searched for him in hopes of adopting Midi himself, but learned of his location too late. He didn't know Midi had been adopted by pirates, and after discovering no such youth counselling service as what the orphanage had on file existed, feared the worst for his cousin.

He is seen by many to be rather imposing at first, an appearance attributed to his height and build, in addition to his often stern-looking face. He enjoys manual labor, which along with his love of good food and drink, has made him into what most would call a bara musclegut. Despite his imposing stature, he is very gentle and has simple tastes, believing that the best things in life are what you make with your own hands.

Rusty currently lives in a small kholu village where he works to build his dream house, keeping a job at the local timber yard and enjoys contributing his namesake to the village's monthly potluck.

**GAMEPLAY:**

Rusty is an extended sidequest character for Midi. Whenever the player finds a special item, they can take it to him to use as decoration for his house. The house's level of completion will match the percentage of quest items found. Each item will trigger a quick timelapse fade as Midi recounts the quest he found it on, and Rusty provides a reaction to each one.

After all items are found, Rusty invites Midi's team to share dinner with him to celebrate the new house. Afterwards, Rusty pulls Midi away and makes him an offer that if Midi ever gets tired of adventuring, he'd be free to move into the house. Midi accepts, but tells him that he still has some adventuring left to do, though he'll still visit when he can.
