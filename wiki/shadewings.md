# Shadewings

Shadewings are [psionic](magic.md) creatures illegally created by Apex Technologies (then known as Applied Excellence) underground research and development team. Their development took place under a maximum security prison that was created as a front for Apex's unsanctioned experiements, where prisoners on death row were taken under ground and used to test Apex's weapons on, as well as unruly inmates who were reportedly "killed by other inmates" or "died in an accident".

The shadewings were created by mixing gryphon and naga DNA, with some parts rewritten to create new traits, including a 100% chance of being born with psionic abilities with the included mastery of a particular ability, and the optional use of telepathy instead of oral speech for communication. The secondary eyelids of nagas were modified to create a shell over the eye that would eliminate glares in vision and help the eyes adjust to darkness, act as a one-way mirror with a matted texture to reduce reflectiveness, and making their expressions incredibly difficult to read.

The color of the eye shell is indicative of the psi ability they are born with. Green eyes means they are born with telekinesis, and red means they can bend energy around themselves to become invisible. Through careful training, they are capable of learning other abilities, eventually reaching the ones their counter-colored counterparts are born with. The abilities are best represented by two trees growing together, eventually having their branches merge.

Shadewings are technically mammals, and all of them can lactate. This was developed as a way to store excess nutrients and hydration for recycling, designed to increase survivability and allow them to go longer without eating by saving predigested portions for later. Males have four active mammary glands, while females have eight to aid in maternal duties.

As their body temperatures are naturally lower than most other races, their reproductive organs are entirely internal, much like a dragon or naga. In order to tell the sex of a shadewing easily without having to count the teats, they were designed to have gray manes and tail tufts when male, and white when female. Of course, counting is always the most reliable method in case one should dye their hair.

Since they were developed for military use, they were also imbued with experimental utilitarian and medical features. Stem cells are produced and destributed through both blood and saliva to aid in healing, and are transferrable to other lifeforms due to their universally variable (UX) bloodtype. The UX engineers developed this special bloodtype by using an amoeba that would trick any body it entered into thinking it belonged by changing its genetic identity to match.

To aid in use of their psi, and to help speed up developing new psionic abilities, the shadewing brain posesses a genetic computer called the Subconsciously Intigrated Computing Assistant, or SICA. It's basically a genetic AI inherrited in the form of a chromosome. SICA can provide analysis, perform automated tasks (however, the shadewing must still provide the energy needed to run these tasks), and communicate through the subconscious with the body to interpret bio feedback, giving shadewings a clearer understanding of what's happening in their systems. SICA can also scan the passive ESP waves emitted by shadewings to detect motion and provide a 3D map of the area, as well as trigger a short burst of neural overclocking known as a theta state that allows shadewings to see and process faster, essentially creating the illusion of slowed time for them. Theta mode is incredibly taxing on the brain, however, and should only be used in short bursts to prevent brain damage.

## Mythology

Since the [first era](history.md), shadewings have been blamed for nightmares and madness, and are said to only appear before those who are doomed to die soon. They were known to appear and disappear silently, could speak directly to the mind, and could enter the dreams of others.

All of these traits were replicated by Apex. The choice to create a mythological creature came from the idea that anyone claiming they saw one would never be believed.
