**BIO:**  
Hunter was originally created during the late Renassiance era by Apex Technologies as the prototype shadewing, but his mind and body were created at separate times. Having been trapped in a cryotube for many decades, Hunter's original mind, named Zero, retreated into the subconscious, while the new mind, who would come to call himself Hunter, slowly began to form as a result. When he was unearthed by the Cold Front, he fled from them, eventually running into [Midi](midi.md).

Being that Midi still had a phobia against shadewings at the time, he attacked at first, but Hunter stood his ground until Midi gave up, and convinced him that he didn't want to hurt him. After explaining what little he could remember to the Cloud Chasers, Hunter asked if he could join them and investigate why he was in the lab.

The team returned to the lab and fought off the Cold Front, but not before the pirates had exhumed a metal shadewing and took it with them. While exploring the lab, Hunter discovers the origins of the shadewings, and after finding none remained in stasis with him, he asks Midi to destroy the lab so that no one could learn the truth and attempt to claim his kind for use as weapons. He then offers to help them fight the Cold Front in exchange for them helping him to find other shadewings to learn more about his kind.

**GAMEPLAY:**  
As a green-eyed shadewing, Hunter is capable of psionic telekinesis similar to the Gravity Gun from Half Life 2. He can lift and throw both heavy objects and certain enemies, in addition to using his claws and fangs for melee attacks.

His wings allow him to glide and perform repeated midair jumps. The number of jumps can be upgraded as the story progresses. His attraction radius, the distance in which he can pull objects, can also be upgraded, and he can learn a number of physics-related techniques.

* Steady Control - By holding the grab and throw buttons at the same time, Hunter can move a held object freely in any direction within his attraction radius.
* Momentum - Works identically to Trey's version of the Speed Booster from Metroid.
* Meteor Dive - Converts falling speed into a shockwave upon landing.
* Hammer Toss - By switching directions left and right, inertial force can be stored in the held object to increase horizontal distance and speed when thrown.
* Devour - When holding small enough creatures, the melee attack will make Hunter eat it for health. This does not effect biometals.
